# Optimized Windows Hosts Files and Miscellaneous Supplementary Content
Within this directory are the optimized Windows hosts files ([1](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/blob/master/NoFormatting/optimized-win.hosts), [2](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/blob/master/NoFormatting/optimized-win-Dual.hosts)) mentioned on the [main readme](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/blob/master/README.md) of this repository; Four versions of [Chef Koch's](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH) infamous [NSA block list](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/tree/master/NoFormatting/NSABlockLists); Two very small lists which assist in blocking tracking servers associated with Device9 ([1](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/blob/master/NoFormatting/Device9domains-IPv4.txt), [2](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/blob/master/NoFormatting/Device9domains-IPv6.txt)); A plain list of [the domains blocked by my hosts files](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/blob/master/NoFormatting/BlacklistedDomains.txt); [My whitelist](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/blob/master/NoFormatting/WhitelistedDomains.txt); A [list of supplementary domains to block](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/blob/master/NoFormatting/AdditionalSupplementaryHosts.txt) (which is compiled from my own observations and an ever-shifting list of sources); Along with stripped down [IPv4](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/blob/master/NoFormatting/hosts.final) and [IPv6-only](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/blob/master/NoFormatting/hostsIPv6.final) hosts files which - aside from formatting - contain the same data as the hosts files mentioned on the main readme of this repository. Finally, the [plain version of my CIDR-format block list](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/blob/master/NoFormatting/combined-flat.cidr) is also available in this subdirectory. File names in here are basically self-explanatory.
