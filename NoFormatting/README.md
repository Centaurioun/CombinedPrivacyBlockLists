# Optimized Windows Hosts Files and Miscellaneous Supplementary Content
Within this directory are the optimized Windows hosts files mentioned on the [main readme](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/blob/master/README.md) of this repository; Four versions of [Chef Koch's](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH) infamous NSA block list; Two very small lists which assist in blocking tracking servers associated with Device9; A plain list of bad domains; A whitelist; A list of supplementary bad domains; Along with stripped down IPv4 and IPv6-only hosts files which - aside from formatting - contain the same data as the hosts files mentioned on the main readme of this repository. Finally, the plain version of my CIDR-format block list is also available in this subdirectory. File names in here are self-explanatory, so I see no need to create a linked index.
