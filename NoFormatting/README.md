# Optimized Windows Hosts Files and Miscellaneous Content
Within this directory are the following items:  

- The optimized Windows hosts files ([1](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/blob/master/NoFormatting/optimized-win.hosts), [2](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/blob/master/NoFormatting/optimized-win-Dual.hosts)) mentioned on the [main readme](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/blob/master/README.md) of this repository.  

- Four versions of [Chef Koch's](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH) infamous [NSA block list](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/tree/master/NoFormatting/NSABlockLists), which are not included in any of my other lists and are simply held here for posterity.  

- Two very small lists which assist in blocking tracking servers associated with Device9 in my main hosts files ([1](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/blob/master/NoFormatting/Device9domains-IPv4.txt), [2](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/blob/master/NoFormatting/Device9domains-IPv6.txt)).  

- A plain list of [the domains blocked by my main hosts files](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/blob/master/NoFormatting/BlacklistedDomains.txt).  

- [The whitelist](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/blob/master/NoFormatting/WhitelistedDomains.txt) for my main hosts files.  

- A [list of supplementary domains to block](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/blob/master/NoFormatting/AdditionalSupplementaryHosts.txt) (which is compiled from my own observations and an ever-shifting list of sources, and is included in my main hosts files).  

- Stripped down [IPv4](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/blob/master/NoFormatting/hosts.final) and [IPv6-only](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/blob/master/NoFormatting/hostsIPv6.final) hosts files which - aside from formatting - contain the same data as the hosts files mentioned on the main readme of this repository.  

- Backups of the Immortal Malware Domain List in [hosts](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/blob/master/NoFormatting/MD-Immortal_Domains-Backup-HOSTS.txt) and [plain domain](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/blob/master/NoFormatting/MD-Immortal_Domains-Backup.txt) formats.  

- Finally, the [plain version of my CIDR-format block list](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/blob/master/NoFormatting/combined-flat.cidr) is also available in this subdirectory.  

File names in here are basically self-explanatory.
