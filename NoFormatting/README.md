# Additional Supplementary and Miscellaneous Content
Within this directory are the following items:  

- Four versions of [Chef Koch's](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH) infamous [NSA block list](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/tree/master/NoFormatting/NSABlockLists), which are **not included in any of my other lists** and are simply housed here for posterity.  

- Backups of the Immortal Malware Domain List in [hosts](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/blob/master/NoFormatting/MD-Immortal_Domains-Backup-HOSTS.txt) and [plain domain](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/blob/master/NoFormatting/MD-Immortal_Domains-Backup.txt) formats. Included in my main hosts files.  

- A [list of supplementary domains to block](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/blob/master/NoFormatting/AdditionalSupplementaryHosts.txt), which is compiled from my own observations, and a semi-frequently shifting list of sources largely focused on threat intelligence (currently a rotating selection of smaller, regularly updated lists from: [1](https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/), [2](https://github.com/davidonzo/Threat-Intel/), [3](https://github.com/stamparm/maltrail/), [4](https://github.com/DRSDavidSoft/additional-hosts/), [5](https://github.com/tiuxo/hosts/), [6](https://v.firebog.net/hosts/), [7](https://github.com/Ultimate-Hosts-Blacklist/2o7.net)). Included in my main hosts files.  

- Two very small lists which assist in blocking tracking servers associated with Device9 in my main hosts files ([1](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/blob/master/NoFormatting/Device9domains-IPv4.txt), [2](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/blob/master/NoFormatting/Device9domains-IPv6.txt)).  

- [The whitelist](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/blob/master/NoFormatting/WhitelistedDomains.txt) for my hosts and PAC files.  

- A plain list of [the domains blocked by my main hosts files](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/blob/master/NoFormatting/BlacklistedDomains.txt).  

- Stripped down [IPv4](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/blob/master/NoFormatting/hosts.final) and [IPv6-only](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/blob/master/NoFormatting/hostsIPv6.final) hosts files which - aside from formatting - contain the same data as the hosts files mentioned on the main readme of this repository.  

- The optimized Windows hosts files ([1](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/blob/master/NoFormatting/optimized-win.hosts), [2](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/blob/master/NoFormatting/optimized-win-Dual.hosts)) mentioned on the [main readme](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/blob/master/README.md) of this repository.  

- The PGL Yoyo Ad-Blocking Hosts file, converted to plain [CIDR Format](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/master/NoFormatting/pgl-yoyo-hosts.cidr), and CIDR format [with `deny from` prepended to each line](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/master/NoFormatting/pgl-yoyo-hosts-deny.cidr).

- Finally, the [plain version of my CIDR-format block list](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/blob/master/NoFormatting/combined-flat.cidr) is also available in this subdirectory.  

File names in here are basically self-explanatory, and I'm well aware at this point, that this directory should be named *AdditionalContent* or something of the sort, but it is what it is.
