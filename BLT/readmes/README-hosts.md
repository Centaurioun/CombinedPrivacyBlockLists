The [update-hosts.sh](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/blob/master/BLT/update-hosts.sh), [update-hosts-dual.sh](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/blob/master/BLT/update-hosts-dual.sh), and [update-hosts-six.sh](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/blob/master/BLT/update-hosts-six.sh) scripts are meant to automate the process of creating and updating your computer's hosts file on GNU/Linux and other Unix-like Operating Systems (like OS X). The Windows version can be found here: https://github.com/bongochong/CWP-Utilities

**Checklist for use**:
1. Ensure that [all relevant files](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/tree/master/BLT) are downloaded to a single directory.
2. Make sure that you have [`pcre (or pcre2 or pcregrep)`](https://www.pcre.org/), [`perl`](https://www.perl.com/about/), and [`wget`](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) installed on your system, along with [`idn2 (or idn)`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/idn) if you wish to use the commented out routine in the scripts for handling Unicode internationalized domains.
3. Open a terminal in or `cd` to the aforementioned directory.
4. Launch the script (`sh update-hosts.sh` should do).
5. Watch the output of the script.
6. Run the script as often as you like to keep your hosts file up to date.
7. Enjoy the magic of having a comprehensive and up-to-date hosts file which protects you from online trackers, advertisements, and exploits.


**Notes**:
- You can whitelist additional domains via appending them to the end of the `hostpatterns.dat` file, which is housed in the `parsing` subdirectory of the utilities. Each whitelisted domain must be preceded by `^0.0.0.0 ` and followed by `$`, just like the preconfigured whitelisted items.

- You can blacklist additional domains via appending them to the relavant `newhosts` template files in the aforementioned `parsing` directory. Each additional blacklist entry must be preceded by `0.0.0.0 `  and/or  `::`.

- If you deviate from the checklist then you are being dumb. This does not apply if you are modifying the files as opposed to using them as is.

- I choose to block servers associated with an advertising and tracking outlet known as [Device9](https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=311903236). Their servers are appended to the hosts file generated by my bash script. I do not know why, but nearly every hosts list and ad-blocking filter list does not block these servers, when they are as nefarious and invasive as the others. 

- These scripts can process both hosts files *and* plain domain lists.  

- For those who wish to generate a hosts file containing entries for both IPv4 and IPv6, please use the `update-hosts-dual.sh` script. For those who wish to generate a hosts file containing entries only for IPv6, please use the `update-hosts-six.sh` script.
