# Hosts Files to Block Windows-related Telemetry
Within this directory are two hosts files which block all known Windows-related telemetry domains *without* preventing the user from utilizing Windows Update. They are generated from my own observations, [Crazy Max's](https://github.com/crazy-max/WindowsSpyBlocker) lighter lists, and output from utilities released by [Safer Networking](https://www.safer-networking.org/). I do not update these as often as the other lists in this repository, as Microsoft's telemetry domains tend to remain the same for very long periods of time. Though, if I notice significant changes to any of the sources, I will quickly perform an update to these. Anyway, the lists are as follows:

- [IPv4 Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/master/WindowsTelemetryBlockSupplements/SBBTYZ-IPv4.txt)

- [IPv6 Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/master/WindowsTelemetryBlockSupplements/SBBTYZ-IPv6.txt)

Enjoy!
