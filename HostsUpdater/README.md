The data within is meant to automate the process of creating and updating your computer's hosts file on GNU/Linux and other Unix-like Operating Systems (like OS X). The Windows version can be found here: https://github.com/bongochong/CWP-Utilities

**Checklist for use**:
1. Ensure that all files herein are downloaded to a single directory.
2. Make sure that you have [PCRE / PCREGREP](https://www.pcre.org/), [Perl](https://www.perl.com/about/), [Wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/), and [Sed](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html) installed on your system.
3. Open a terminal in or cd to the aforementioned directory.
4. Launch the script (`sh update-hosts-withPrompts.sh` should do).
5. Carefully follow the prompt(s).
6. Run the script as often as you like to keep your hosts file up to date.
7. Enjoy the magic of having a comprehensive and up-to-date hosts file which protects you from online trackers, advertisements, and exploits.


**Notes**:
- If you deviate from the checklist then you are stupid. This does not apply if you are modifying the files as opposed to using them as is.

- I choose to block servers associated with an advertising and tracking outlet known as [Device9](https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=311903236). Their servers are appended to the hosts file generated by my bash script. I do not know why, but nearly every hosts list and ad-blocking filter list does not block these servers, when they are as nefarious and invasive as the others. 

- For those who wish to generate a hosts file containing entries for both IPv4 and IPv6, please use the `update-hosts-Dual-withPrompts.sh` script.
