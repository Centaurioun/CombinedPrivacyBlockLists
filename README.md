# PACandHostsFileStuffForPersonalUse
Ad-blocking hosts files, PAC files, and BitTorrent IP block lists, all merged and de-duped from multiple reputable sources.

**Descriptions**

+ [**combined-final-win.dat**](https://github.com/bongochong/PACandHostsFileStuffForPersonalUse/raw/master/newhosts-final.hosts): Is an IP blocklist suitable for use in torrent clients like Halite for Windows. The list is merged from BlueTack levels 1 and 2, then deduped and sorted using homemade bash scripts.

* **combined-final.p2p**: Is an IP blocklist suitable for use in torrent clients like qBitTorrent and Transmission under any OS. The list is merged from BlueTack levels 1 and 2, then deduped and sorted using homemade bash scripts.

- **newhosts-final.hosts**: Is an ad and tracker-blocking hosts list, taken from MVPS, PGL Yoyo, Malware Domain List, and Hosts-File, then merged, sorted and deduped using homemade bash scripts. 

+ **yoyo.pac & yoyo.pac.js**: Are Proxy AutoConfig files meant to block advertising servers. Right now I am only hosting the lists from PGL Yoyo, but I plan to create master PAC files using a similar approach to my hosts files and IP blocklists.

***Please feel free to subscribe to these lists. I use them on all of my personal machines.***
