# PACandHostsFileStuffForPersonalUse
Ad-blocking hosts files, PAC files, and BitTorrent IP block lists, all merged and de-duped from multiple reputable sources.

**Descriptions**

+ [**combined-final-win.dat**](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/raw/master/combined-final-win.dat): Is an IP blocklist suitable for use in torrent clients like Halite for Windows.<sup>1</sup> The list is merged from BlueTack levels 1 and 2, then deduped and sorted using homemade bash scripts.

* [**combined-final.p2p**](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/raw/master/combined-final.p2p): Is an IP blocklist suitable for use in torrent clients like qBitTorrent and Transmission under any OS.<sup>2</sup> <sup>3</sup> The list is merged from BlueTack levels 1 and 2, then deduped and sorted using homemade bash scripts.

- [**newhosts-final.hosts**](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/raw/master/newhosts-final.hosts): Is an ad and tracker-blocking hosts list, taken from MVPS, PGL Yoyo, Malware Domain List, and Hosts-File, then merged, sorted and deduped using homemade bash scripts. 

+ [**yoyo.pac**](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/raw/master/yoyo.pac) & [**yoyo.pac.js**](https://github.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/raw/master/yoyo.pac.js): Are Proxy AutoConfig files meant to block advertising servers. Right now I am only hosting the lists from PGL Yoyo, but I plan to create master PAC files using a similar approach to my hosts files and IP blocklists.

***Please feel free to subscribe to these lists. I use them on all of my personal machines.***

P.S. All of these files can be downloaded in a [compressed archive hosted on Disroot's NextCloud](https://cloud.disroot.org/s/5TnQ9jBtbSnTj8y/download). Both this repo and the NextCloud mirror will be updated approximately every 3 weeks.
