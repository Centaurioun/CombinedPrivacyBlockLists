The data within is meant to automate the process of creating and updating an IP block list for your BitTorrent client (if you use one that prefers DAT lists, like Halite).

All dependencies are satisfied via several [GnuWin32](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/) utilities, which are included in the [\bin](/WindowsUtils/WinIPBlockDAT/bin/) directory, so you dont have to download anything else.

**Checklist for use**:
1. Ensure that all files herein are downloaded to a single directory.
2. Run update-bt-bl-dat.bat either by double-clicking the file, or via the command prompt.
3. Watch as it generates a comprehensive block list for your torrent client.
4. Move the resulting blocklist (combined-final-win.dat) to a directory of your choice, and configure your torrent client to use it.
4. Enjoy the magic of having a comprehensive and up-to-date IP block list that provides you with considerable protection against malicious activity on BitTorrent sites.


**Notes**:
- If you deviate from the checklist then you are stupid. This does not apply if you are modifying the files as opposed to using them as is.
