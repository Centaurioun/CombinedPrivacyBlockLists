This directory is for the Windows versions of my script applications. Windows users are now strongly encouraged to use the vastly imroved implementation of these scripts as part of my [Combined Windows Privacy Utilities software suite](https://github.com/bongochong/CWP-Utilities) instead. They are easier to work with in there, do more better, and now come with a cohesive old-school interface.

Regardless, all of my GNU/Linux tools have finally been ported to work on Windows. They are as follows:

+ [**Windows Hosts File Updater**](/WindowsUtils/WinHostsUpdater/) - Fully automated and easy-to-configure batch script for updating your hosts file from multiple sources. Only requirement outside of this repo is Java. Pre-configured and works out of the box. *An improved version of this (one that does not rely on Java for any parsing), based on progress I made in my [main Windows script utilities repo](https://github.com/bongochong/CWP-Utilities) should be up soon.*

* [**Windows BitTorrent IP Block Updater (DAT Format)**](/WindowsUtils/WinIPBlockDAT/) - Batch script for automated generation of an IP block list from multiple sources for torrent clients like Halite. No additional software needed outside of this repo. Pre-configured and runs out of the box.

- [**Windows BitTorrent IP Block Updater (P2P Format)**](/WindowsUtils/WinIPBlockP2P/) - Batch script for automated generation of an IP block list from multiple sources for torrent clients like qBitTorrent and Transmission. No additional software needed outside of this repo. Pre-configured and runs out of the box.

+ [**Windows PAC Updater**](/WindowsUtils/WinPACUpdater/) - Template for a batch script that automatically updates and uploads an ad-blocking PAC file to your server of choice. No additional software needed outside of this repo. Requires configuration before running.
