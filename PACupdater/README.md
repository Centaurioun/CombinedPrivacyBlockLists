The .sh file herein is a _template_ for a really simple bash script, which downloads the ad-blocking PAC file from PGL Yoyo, does a little clean-up on it, then uploads it to an FTP server of your choice (so you can easily utilize it). This script is meant to be modified to your liking, then run via the command line. I plan on expanding the script to pull in hosts lists from various sources for generating a more comprehensive PAC file, but this will have to do for now.

Note: You must have [Perl](https://www.perl.com/about/), [Wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/), [Curl](https://curl.haxx.se/), and [Sed](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html) installed on your system to utilize this script.
