The data within is meant to automate the process of creating and updating an IP block list for your BitTorrent client (if you use one that prefers P2P lists). The script's use is currently limited to GNU/Linux and other Unix-like systems, but I plan to create a version which can be run natively on Windows as well. The block list it generates is of-course perfectly compatible with Windows torrent clients though.


**Checklist for use**:
1. Ensure that all files herein are downloaded to a single directory
2. Open a terminal in or cd to the aforementioned directory
3. Launch the script ("sh update-bt-bl-withPrompts.sh" should do)
4. Carefully follow the prompt(s)
5. Run the script as often as you like to keep your BitTorrent IP block list up to date.
6. Enjoy the magic of having a comprehensive and up-to-date IP block list that provides you with considerable protection against malicious activity on BitTorrent sites.


**Notes**:
- If you deviate from the checklist then you are stupid. This does not apply if you are modifying the files as opposed to using them as is.
