# Hosts Files Generated from Popular AdBlock Plus-compatible Subscriptions
Within this directory are lists converted to the hosts format from popular AdBlock Plus-compatible subscriptions. They are as follows:

- [AdGuard Mobile Hosts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/master/ABP2Hosts/adguard_mobile-hosts.txt) - This is a light hosts file which contains very useful entries for blocking **mobile** advertising, trackers, and malware. It is generated from the following AdGuard filter lists: [1](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/MobileFilter/sections/adservers.txt); [2](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/MobileFilter/sections/spyware.txt).

- [AdGuard Desktop Hosts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/master/ABP2Hosts/adguard_desktop-hosts.txt) - This is also a light hosts file, which contains very useful entries for blocking general advertising, trackers, and malware. It is generated from the following AdGuard filter lists: [1](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/EnglishFilter/sections/adservers.txt); [2](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/EnglishFilter/sections/adservers_firstparty.txt); [3](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/SpywareFilter/sections/tracking_servers.txt); [4](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/EnglishFilter/sections/cryptominers.txt).

- [EasyList Desktop Hosts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bongochong/CombinedPrivacyBlockLists/master/ABP2Hosts/easylist_desktop-hosts.txt) - This is a middle-weight hosts file, which also contains very useful entries for blocking general advertising, trackers, and malware. It is generated from the following EasyList & EasyPrivacy filter lists: [1](https://github.com/easylist/easylist/blob/master/easylist/easylist_adservers.txt); [2](https://github.com/easylist/easylist/blob/master/easylist/easylist_thirdparty.txt); [3](https://github.com/easylist/easylist/blob/master/easyprivacy/easyprivacy_trackingservers.txt); [4](https://github.com/easylist/easylist/blob/master/easyprivacy/easyprivacy_thirdparty.txt).

These will be updated once a week. They are compiled via fetching the filter lists with curl and piping them through a series of parsing commands, to remove content that is incompatible with hosts files. I am focused on ensuring that no false-positives end up in these lists, so my routines may be considered relatively aggressive in avoiding that. This ensures that these specific hosts lists do *not* break important functionality on widely visited sites. Enjoy.
